% within a LaTeX document.


% \tiogafigurefullpage[minwhitespace]{figurename}
%
% \tiogafigurefullpage shows a version of the picture scaled to fit the 
% paper size minus the minwhitespace.  The minwhitespace is the sum of 
% the margins on both sides, top and bottom or left and right. 
% The minwhitespace defaults to 2 inches.
%
\newcommand{\tiogafigurefullpage}[2][2in]{
  \tiogafigurescaledtofit{#2}{\paperwidth - (#1)}{\paperheight - (#1)}}


% \tiogafigurescaledtofit{figurename}{maxwidth}{maxheight}
%
% \tiogafigurescaledtofit shows a version of the picture scaled to fit the
% given width and height while preserving the aspect ratio.
% The 1st arg is the base name for the pdf and txt files.
% The 2nd arg determines the maximum figure width.
% The 3rd arg determines the maximum figure height.

% \tiogafigurescaled{figurename}{scalefactor}

% \tiogafigurescaled shows a scaled version of the picture
% The 1st arg is the base name for the pdf and txt files.
% The 2nd arg determines the scale.
\newcommand{\tiogafigurescaled}[2]{

% \tiogafigurescaledxy{figurename}{xscalefactor}{yscalefactor}
%
% \tiogafigurescaledxy shows a scaled version of the picture where you
% can use different scaling factors in the horizontal and vertical directions.
% The 1st arg is the base name for the pdf and txt files.
% The 2nd arg determines the horizontal scale.
% The 3rd arg determines the vertical scale.
\newcommand{\tiogafigurescaledxy}[3]{

% \tiogafiguresized{figurename}{figurewidth}{figureheight}
%
% \tiogafiguresized shows a scaled version of the picture, where you
% can specify the actual size you want.  If either length is
% given as !, the one scale factor is used in both directions.
% The 1st arg is the base name for the pdf and txt files.
% The 2nd arg determines the figure width.
% The 3rd arg determines the figure height.

% To change it, use \renewcommand as in the following example:

% \tiogafigureshow{figurename}
%
% \tiogafigureshow shows the figure and the accompanying text.
% Inside a box, it first creates a picture that includes the pdf
% file with the graphics for the figure, then it includes the text.
% The \tiogaprefix is added at the start of the file names for both.
